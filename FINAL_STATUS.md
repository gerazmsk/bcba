# Final Status

## ✅ What's Working:
- Sign up / Login ✅
- Profile creation ✅ 
- Profile save ✅
- Profile search ✅
- Database connected ✅

## ❌ What's Not Working:
- **Clicking profile in search** → 404 error

## Root Cause:
This is likely an **RLS (Row Level Security) policy issue** in Supabase. The server can't read profiles even though they're public.

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
localhost:3000
```
Test if it works locally (without Railway)

### Option 2: Check Supabase RLS Policies
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/utbnvtrquhdurakxrvql/auth/policies

Make sure you have these policies:
1. "Read public profiles" - allows SELECT where is_public = true
2. "Users can read own profile" - allows users to see their own profile

### Option 3: Temporarily Disable RLS (Testing Only!)
In Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```
⚠️ This removes security - only for testing!

## What You Should Do NOW:

1. **Tell me:** Does the search page work? Can you see your profile?
2. **Try this:** Click on your profile in search. What happens?
3. **Check:** In Supabase Table Editor, what's the exact value in the `id` column for your profile?
