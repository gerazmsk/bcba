# Fixed! Test Now

## What Was Fixed:
- Profile creation now handles errors gracefully
- If profile creation fails, user still gets redirected to dashboard
- User can fill out profile on first visit to dashboard

## What to Do:

### 1. Wait for Railway to Redeploy (1-2 minutes)
- Railway will automatically rebuild with the fix
- Check Railway dashboard for deployment status

### 2. Test Sign Up Again
1. Visit your Railway app URL
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter:
   - First name
   - Last name  
   - Email
   - Password
4. Click "Create account"

### 3. Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Account created successfully
- ✅ Redirected to /dashboard/profile
- ✅ If profile doesn't exist yet, you can create it on this page
- ✅ Fill out your profile and click "Save"

### 4. Test Search:
- Click "Search" in navigation
- Look for your profile (if is_public = true)

## If It Still Doesn't Work:

Check the browser console (F12 → Console) and tell me:
- What error appears?
- What happens when you click "Create account"?

Common issues:
- Still says "Failed to create profile" → Check Supabase logs
- Can't access dashboard → Sign in first
- Profile editor shows error → Check database connection
