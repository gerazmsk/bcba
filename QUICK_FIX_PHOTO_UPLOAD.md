# Adding Photo Upload to Your App

## Current Status:
- You can paste a photo URL
- But you want to upload photos directly from your computer

## This Requires:
1. Supabase Storage bucket setup
2. File upload component
3. ~20-30 minutes of work

## Options:

### Option 1: Keep URL Upload (Easier)
- Upload photo to imgur.com
- Copy the URL
- Paste in the app
- Done in 2 minutes

### Option 2: Add File Upload (Full Feature)
- Upload directly from computer
- Photo stored in Supabase
- More complex setup

Would you like me to:
- **A)** Keep it simple with URL upload (working now)
- **B)** Add full file upload feature

Let me know which you prefer!
