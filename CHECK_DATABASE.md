# How to Check Database

## ‚úÖ Quick Check in Supabase:

1. I just opened: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/utbnvtrquhdurakxrvql/editor
2. You should see a "profiles" table
3. Click on it
4. Do you see any rows? If yes, how many?
5. Click on a row - check if "is_public" is set to TRUE

## üîç What to Look For:

**If profiles table is EMPTY:**
- Profile wasn't saved to database
- We need to debug the save function

**If profiles table has rows:**
- Check if `is_public` column = `true`
- If `false`, that's why it's not showing in search

**If you see your profile but it's not in search:**
- The search query might not be working
- Try searching with exact match

## üìù Tell Me:

1. How many rows in the profiles table?
2. If there are rows, is `is_public` = true?
3. What's the `first_name` and `last_name` of the profiles?
